# Enterprise Storyboard Patterns

**Goal**: Prove the interactivity of components in a simulated user journey context within the Design System Hub (`showcase/index.html`). Static previews are insufficient.

## Standard Storyboard Flows

1. **Talent Onboarding Board (Drag & Drop Simulation)**
   - Show a draggable `TalentCard`.
   - Show a targeted `DropZone` in a Team Zone.
   - Visually represent the "ghost" image during the drag interaction.

2. **Error Recovery Board**
   - Present a Modal or Card in an Error State.
   - Outline the resolution flow (e.g., a "Retry" Primary button recovering the network request).

3. **Kanban Flow Board**
   - Demonstrate the progression of a `TaskCard` moving from the `Backlog` column into an `In Progress` column.
   - Show visual cue changes during column transition.
