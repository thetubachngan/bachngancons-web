# Bách Ngân Construction Web - Agent Guidelines

1. You MUST always ensure the Design System works perfectly.
2. The Design System is located at `/docs/design`.
3. To view or test the Design System locally, you MUST ensure that the command `npm run dev` works without error.
4. **Port is fixed to `9995`** in `vite.config.js`. `npm run dev` will serve the application on `http://localhost:9995`. Always test your UI/UX changes there.
